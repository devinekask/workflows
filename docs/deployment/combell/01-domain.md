# Register your domain

Let's demonstrate how you can register your own domain.

Think about the name of your domain because you will use it during your studies to build a portfolio. An url like [http://party-animal-4-life.be](http://party-animal-4-life.be) does not look very professional in a job interview.

## Request your free license

You can request a license through the academic software website so that you can register your domain for free with Combell.

Navigate to [Academic Software](https://auth.academicsoftware.be/), enter your Howest e-mail address and click `Login`

Search for the **Combell Webhosting (Linux)**. Check, double check and triple check if you have picked the Linux version!

Click on `Request`  to get a license. Write down or store the code that appears on the screen, you will need it in the next step.

WARNING: YOU CAN ONLY REQUEST THE CODE ONCE!

## Register the domain

Navigate to [Combell Business](https://www.combell.com/en/hosting/connect/business).

Choose an url followed by .be - the licence is only valid for .be domains.  The name is without spaces and all characters are in lowercase. **You cannot change this name, so think about the url you pick for yourself.**

Add the domain if it's still available. Otherwise, you need to try a different name. You do not need to add other extensions such as .com, .app, ... because you will be charged for most of them.
